# Speak the World React Web App

June 2022

I have utilised four APIs. Facebook API for authentication and retrieving post messages, Google Map API for displaying map and determining geo information, then Google Translate API is used for finding language ISO code and translation of Facebook posts and finally ResponsiveVoice API to play speech voice in many different languages retrieved from Google Translate.
